## SQLAlchemy-Challenge Homework

We were tasked to use SQLAlchemy and Flask API to explore and analyze climate data from a hawaii.sqlite database.<br/>
Analysis was performed using Python and Pandas (Jupyter Notebook).<br/>

1. Climate Analysis and Expoloration
This step involved reviewing the sqlite database and its temperature and precipitation data.<br/>

1. Preciption Analysis
This .png depicts one year of precipitation values that were recorded:

This .png is a statistical summary of the precipitation data:

3. Station Analysis
This histogram represents one year of the most active station's temperature data:

Climate App
After running the app.py in/with Python, you will see an API that includes:
1. All available routes
1. Stations = All Station names
1. Precipitation = Date and Precipitation values for one year of data
1. TOBS = one year of the most active station's data
1. Start Date (couldn't figure this out)
1. Start Date/End Date (couldn't figure this out)
